# Current State - After Enhanced Data Collection Implementation

## What's Working ✅
- Frontend displays at http://localhost:3000
- Backend API at http://localhost:5000
- PostgreSQL persistence fully working
- 4 services integrated and enhanced (Radarr, Sonarr, Plex, Prowlarr)
- Custom TaylorDex logo with gradient text
- Enhanced Status Dashboard with 3 views (Overview, Activity, Performance)

## Recent Changes (August 4, 2025 - Evening Session #2)

## Services Configuration
| Service | Backend Module | Frontend UI | Enhanced Data | Status |
|---------|---------------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Radarr | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | Working |
| Sonarr | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | Working |
| Plex | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | Offline (needs token) |
| Prowlarr | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | Working |

## Data Collection Details

### What Each Service Provides:
- **Radarr**: Movies, queue, recent additions, quality breakdown, health, upcoming releases
- **Sonarr**: Series, episodes, airing schedule, queue, recent episodes, health
- **Plex**: Libraries, active streams, bandwidth, recently added, performance metrics
- **Prowlarr**: Indexer stats, 24h metrics, success rates, connected apps

### API Endpoints:
- GET /api/services - List all services with basic stats
- GET /api/{service}/{id}/stats - Get enhanced stats for specific service
- GET /api/services/status/comprehensive - Get aggregated data (not implemented yet)
- GET /api/{service}/{id}/test-endpoints - Debug endpoint for testing

## Known Issues
- Plex showing offline (needs proper X-Plex-Token configuration)
- Some Sonarr downloads showing without episode titles
- Need to implement comprehensive status endpoint

## Next Tasks for Sonarr Enhancement
1. Fix episode title parsing in queue items
2. Add more detailed series statistics
3. Implement calendar view for upcoming episodes
4. Add season progress tracking
5. Show which episodes are missing

## Technical Notes
- Queue parsing fixed: Now correctly extracts movie titles from sourceTitle
- Error handling: Each data point has try/catch to prevent cascade failures
- Performance: Parallel API calls for faster data collection
- Modularity: Each service module is independent

Last Updated: August 4, 2025 - Enhanced data collection system complete
