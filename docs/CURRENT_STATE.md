# Current State - After Status Dashboard Implementation

## What's Working ✅
- Frontend displays at http://localhost:3000
- Beautiful UI with NVIDIA-green theme
- Component architecture established
- Full backend API integration
- ServiceCard fetches real stats from *arr services
- Add Service Modal with test connection
- Backend connects to Radarr/Sonarr/etc
- Delete service functionality with dropdown menu
- Edit service modal with all fields
- Enable/disable toggle working properly
- Service logos with gradient backgrounds
- Individual service refresh in dropdown
- PostgreSQL persistence fully working
- **NEW: Status Dashboard with aggregate stats**
- **NEW: Service health monitoring visualization**
- **NEW: Storage distribution charts**
- **NEW: Quick stats cards for system overview**

## Backend Endpoints
- POST /api/services - Add new service
- GET /api/services - List all services  
- PUT /api/services/:id - Update service ✅ Fixed enabled field
- DELETE /api/services/:id - Delete service ✅ Now used
- POST /api/services/test - Test connection
- GET /api/:serviceType/:serviceId/stats - Get service stats

## UI Components Status
- ServiceCard: ✅ Complete with options menu, logos, stats
- AddServiceModal: ✅ Working with logo preview
- EditServiceModal: ✅ Complete with enable/disable
- ServicesTab: ✅ Shows count, refresh all, modals
- StatusTab: ✅ NEW - Aggregate stats, health monitoring, storage viz
- Header: ✅ Shows online/total services
- TabNavigation: ✅ Working
- Logs Tab: ⚠️ Basic placeholder
- Users Tab: ⚠️ Basic placeholder
- Settings Tab: ⚠️ Basic implementation

## Database Status
- PostgreSQL: ✅ Connected and working
- Schema: ✅ services and service_stats tables created
- Persistence: ✅ Services saved between restarts
- Stats caching: ✅ Working

## What's NOT Working ❌
- Logs tab (still placeholder)
- Users tab (still placeholder)
- Service auto-discovery
- Settings tab needs real functionality
- Activity timeline/history in Status tab
- Download queue monitoring

## Recent Changes (Status Dashboard)
- Created StatusTab component with modular sub-components
- Added aggregate statistics calculation
- Implemented service health percentage
- Added storage distribution visualization
- Created quick stats cards (health, media, missing, storage)
- Service status grid with online/offline indicators
- Disk usage bars with service-specific gradients
- Respects enabled/disabled service states

## Next Immediate Tasks
1. Add activity timeline to Status Dashboard
2. Implement download queue monitoring
3. Service auto-discovery feature
4. Add more service types (Plex, Jellyfin, etc)
5. Create logs viewer with service filtering
6. Add user management
7. Export/Import configuration feature
8. Real-time notifications for service status changes

## Technical Debt
- Error handling could be more robust
- No toast notifications for actions
- No loading skeletons during data fetch
- Settings tab needs real functionality
- Need charts library for better visualizations (Chart.js or Recharts)
- Consider adding WebSocket for real-time updates
