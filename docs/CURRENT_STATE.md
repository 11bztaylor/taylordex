- Schema: ✅ services and service_stats tables
- Persistence: ✅ Services saved between restarts
- Stats caching: ✅ Working for all services

## Recent Session Achievements
1. Built complete Status Dashboard
2. Added Sonarr integration module
3. Implemented service type filtering
4. Added refresh functionality
5. Enhanced empty states

## Next Immediate Tasks
1. Implement remaining *arr services (Bazarr, Lidarr, etc)
2. Add activity timeline to Status Dashboard
3. Implement download queue monitoring
4. Service auto-discovery feature
5. Create logs viewer with service filtering
6. Add user management
7. Export/Import configuration
8. Real-time notifications

## Quick Start Commands
cd /home/zach/projects/docker-dashboard && pwd
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs -f
git status

Last Updated: Session with Status Dashboard & Sonarr

## Modular Service Architecture

Each service is completely isolated in its own module:
- Service logic in service.js
- API routes in routes.js (REQUIRED!)
- Optional controller.js for complex operations
- Dynamic loading - no registration needed except routes

### Currently Implemented Services
- ✅ Radarr (movies)
- ✅ Sonarr (TV series)  
- ✅ Prowlarr (indexers)
- ✅ Plex (media server)
- ⏳ Bazarr (subtitles) - skeleton exists
- ⏳ Lidarr (music) - skeleton exists
- ⏳ Readarr (ebooks) - skeleton exists

## Lessons Learned
1. Always create routes.js - backend crashes without it
2. Update both AddServiceModal AND ServiceCard for frontend
3. Use curl for logos, wget might save HTML
4. Test services individually before committing
5. Routes must be registered in backend/index.js
