# Current State - After Backend Integration

## What's Working ✅
- Frontend displays at http://localhost:3000
- Beautiful UI with NVIDIA-green theme
- Component architecture established
- **NEW: Full backend API integration**
- **NEW: ServiceCard fetches real stats**
- **NEW: Add Service Modal created**
- **NEW: Backend connects to Radarr/Sonarr**
- **NEW: Service management (add/edit/delete)**

## Backend Endpoints Created
- POST /api/services - Add new service
- GET /api/services - List all services
- PUT /api/services/:id - Update service
- DELETE /api/services/:id - Delete service
- GET /api/:serviceType/:serviceId/stats - Get service stats

## What's Partially Working ⚠️
- Services stored in memory (not database yet)
- Basic error handling implemented
- Stats fetching works for *arr services

## What's NOT Working ❌
- Database persistence (using in-memory)
- Logs/Users/Settings tabs still placeholders
- Service auto-discovery
- Advanced error recovery

## Recent Changes (Backend Integration Session)
- Created backend/src/ structure
- Added service controllers
- Implemented CRUD operations
- Connected frontend to backend
- Added AddServiceModal component
- Loading states in ServiceCard

## Next Immediate Tasks
1. Add PostgreSQL persistence
2. Create database migrations
3. Implement service auto-discovery
4. Build Status dashboard tab
5. Add comprehensive error handling

## Files Modified
- backend/index.js - Added all routes
- backend/src/controllers/* - Service logic
- ServiceCard.jsx - Stats fetching
- ServicesTab.jsx - Modal integration
- App.jsx - State management
