# Current State - After PM Session 4 (Service Card Enhancements)

## What's Working ✅
- Frontend displays at http://localhost:3000
- Beautiful UI with NVIDIA-green theme
- Component architecture established
- Full backend API integration
- ServiceCard fetches real stats from *arr services
- Add Service Modal with test connection
- Backend connects to Radarr/Sonarr/etc
- **NEW: Delete service functionality with dropdown menu**
- **NEW: Edit service modal with all fields**
- **NEW: Enable/disable toggle working properly**
- **NEW: Service logos with gradient backgrounds**
- **NEW: Individual service refresh in dropdown**
- **NEW: PostgreSQL persistence fully working**

## Backend Endpoints
- POST /api/services - Add new service
- GET /api/services - List all services  
- PUT /api/services/:id - Update service ✅ Fixed enabled field
- DELETE /api/services/:id - Delete service ✅ Now used
- POST /api/services/test - Test connection
- GET /api/:serviceType/:serviceId/stats - Get service stats

## UI Components Status
- ServiceCard: ✅ Complete with options menu, logos, stats
- AddServiceModal: ✅ Working with logo preview
- EditServiceModal: ✅ Complete with enable/disable
- ServicesTab: ✅ Shows count, refresh all, modals
- Header: ✅ Shows online/total services
- TabNavigation: ✅ Working
- Status Tab: ⚠️ Basic implementation, needs enhancement

## Database Status
- PostgreSQL: ✅ Connected and working
- Schema: ✅ services and service_stats tables created
- Persistence: ✅ Services saved between restarts
- Stats caching: ✅ Working

## What's NOT Working ❌
- Logs/Users tabs (still placeholders)
- Service auto-discovery
- Status Dashboard needs full implementation
- Settings tab is basic

## Recent Changes (Session 4)
- Fixed docker-compose.yml version warning
- Added three-dot dropdown menu to ServiceCard
- Implemented delete with confirmation
- Created EditServiceModal component
- Fixed enable/disable toggle persistence
- Added service logos from homelab-svg-assets
- Downloaded logos to frontend/public/logos/
- Added gradient backgrounds for each service type
- Improved stats display formatting

## Next Immediate Tasks
1. Build out Status Dashboard with graphs/charts
2. Implement service auto-discovery
3. Add more service types (Plex, Jellyfin, etc)
4. Create logs viewer
5. Add user management
6. Export/Import configuration feature

## Technical Debt
- Error handling could be more robust
- No toast notifications for actions
- No loading skeletons during data fetch
- Settings tab needs real functionality
