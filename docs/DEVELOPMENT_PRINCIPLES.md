# Development Principles & Best Practices

## Core Development Philosophy

### Technical Decision Making
- **Scalability First**: Always consider how solutions will perform at scale
- **Industry Standards**: Prefer established patterns and widely-adopted approaches
- **Maintainability**: Code should be easy to understand and modify
- **Performance**: Optimize for real-world usage patterns
- **Security**: Security considerations must be built-in, not bolted-on

### Communication Standards
- **Fact-Based Discussions**: Present technical merits, drawbacks, and trade-offs
- **Challenge Assumptions**: Question implementation approaches when better alternatives exist  
- **Neutral Tone**: Avoid excessive praise or validation-seeking language
- **Solution-Oriented**: Focus on what works best for the project, not personal preferences

## Implementation Guidelines

### When to Challenge Proposed Solutions
Always evaluate and potentially counter-propose when:
1. A simpler, more maintainable approach exists
2. Industry standards suggest a different pattern
3. Performance implications haven't been considered
4. Security concerns aren't addressed
5. Scalability limitations are apparent
6. The proposed solution creates technical debt

### Technology Selection Criteria
Prioritize solutions that offer:
- **Proven track record** in production environments
- **Active community support** and ongoing development
- **Clear documentation** and learning resources
- **Backward compatibility** considerations
- **Performance characteristics** that meet project needs

### Architecture Decisions
- Prefer **composition over inheritance**
- Use **dependency injection** for testability
- Implement **graceful degradation** for external services
- Design for **horizontal scaling** from the start
- Plan for **failure scenarios** and recovery

## Service Integration Standards

### Real-Time vs Polling
- **WebSocket connections** for real-time data streams
- **REST APIs** for CRUD operations and commands
- **Hybrid approaches** when both patterns provide value
- **Polling only** when real-time options aren't available

### Command Execution Patterns
1. **Native API methods** (preferred)
2. **Service-specific command APIs** (second choice)  
3. **Containerized command execution** (when isolation needed)
4. **SSH/remote execution** (last resort, security implications)

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Fail fast** for configuration errors
- **Graceful degradation** for service unavailability
- **Exponential backoff** for retry logic
- **Circuit breaker pattern** for unreliable services
- **Comprehensive logging** for debugging

## Code Quality Standards

### BaseService Pattern Extensions
- All service integrations must extend BaseService
- Implement standardized error handling
- Use consistent configuration patterns
- Provide comprehensive test coverage
- Document integration-specific requirements

### Performance Considerations
- **Connection pooling** for database and HTTP clients
- **Caching strategies** for expensive operations
- **Batch processing** where applicable
- **Lazy loading** for optional features
- **Resource cleanup** for long-running processes

## Refactoring Guidelines

### When to Refactor Existing Code
Refactoring is warranted when:
- New requirements reveal architectural limitations
- Performance bottlenecks are identified
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered
- Industry standards evolve
- Technical debt impacts development velocity

### Backward Compatibility
- Maintain API compatibility during minor versions
- Provide migration paths for breaking changes
- Document deprecation timelines
- Support gradual adoption of new patterns

## Decision Documentation

### Technical Decision Records (TDRs)
Document major architectural decisions including:
- **Context**: What problem are we solving?
- **Options**: What approaches were considered?
- **Decision**: What was chosen and why?
- **Consequences**: What are the trade-offs?

### Review Process
- Technical decisions should be reviewed by multiple contributors
- Consider long-term maintenance implications
- Evaluate impact on existing integrations
- Plan for testing and rollback scenarios
