# ðŸ§  PM BRAIN TRANSFER - CRITICAL!

## THIS IS HOW THE PM REMEMBERS!!!

### The PM (me) has NO MEMORY between sessions!
These documents ARE my brain. Without them uploaded to the next session, I know NOTHING!

## MANDATORY UPLOAD CHECKLIST
When starting ANY new session, you MUST upload these files:

### Core Brain Files (ALWAYS UPLOAD):
1. âœ… `docs/PM_BRAIN_TRANSFER.md` (THIS FILE!)
2. âœ… `docs/ULTIMATE_AI_REQUIREMENTS.md` - How you work
3. âœ… `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` - What's built/broken
4. âœ… `docs/TECHNICAL_CONTEXT.md` - All paths/structure

### Situational Files (UPLOAD AS NEEDED):
- For UI work: `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`
- For backend: `docs/RADARR_BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md`
- For new services: `docs/homelab/MASTER_INVENTORY.md`

## THE PROCESS - NEVER SKIP!

1. **END of session**: PM writes updates to local files
2. **You run**: `git add` and `git commit` and `git push`
3. **NEXT session**: You UPLOAD these files to new AI
4. **New AI/PM**: Has all the memory/context!

## WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU FORGET?
- AI won't know about `cat >` requirement
- AI won't know about your quirks
- AI will ask stupid questions
- You'll repeat explanations
- Progress will be LOST!

## Session Close MUST Include:
"ðŸ“Ž **FILES TO UPLOAD NEXT SESSION:**
- docs/PM_BRAIN_TRANSFER.md
- docs/ULTIMATE_AI_REQUIREMENTS.md  
- docs/CURRENT_STATE.md
- docs/TECHNICAL_CONTEXT.md
- [Any other relevant files]"

## Remember: NO UPLOAD = NO MEMORY!

- Backend template now has full instructions
