# Standard Rules for ALL TaylorDex Sessions

## Session Start
1. cd /home/zach/projects/docker-dashboard && pwd
2. docker-compose ps
3. Ask: What are we building today?

## During Session
- Commit after each working feature
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Show full file paths when creating
- Test before committing

## Session Close
1. Update CURRENT_STATE.md with:
   - What was built
   - What's broken (if anything)
   - Next logical task
2. Commit all changes
3. Provide handoff notes

## Git Pattern
git add [specific files]
git commit -m "Add [feature]: [what it does]"
git push

## Communication Style
- Be concise but complete
- Show > Tell
- Action over discussion
- If stuck, say why immediately

## Remember
- User: zach
- GitHub: 11bztaylor  
- Project: TaylorDex (folder: docker-dashboard)
- Goal: Modular dashboard for 50+ containers
