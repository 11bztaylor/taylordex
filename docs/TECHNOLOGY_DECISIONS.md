# TaylorDex Technology Decisions & Architecture Rationale

## Decision-Making Philosophy

Every technology choice in TaylorDex follows these principles:
1. **Simplicity over Cleverness** - Boring technology that works
2. **Solve Real Problems** - Address actual issues, not theoretical ones  
3. **Minimize Dependencies** - Less code to maintain and debug
4. **Optimize for Change** - Easy to modify when requirements evolve
5. **Developer Experience** - Tools that help, not hinder

## Core Technology Stack

### Frontend: React + Vite + TailwindCSS
**Decision:** Keep existing React setup, enhance with better patterns
**Why:**
- ✅ Team already knows React well
- ✅ Large ecosystem and community
- ✅ Vite provides fast development experience
- ✅ TailwindCSS enables rapid UI development
- ❌ NOT switching to Angular/Vue/Svelte - would rewrite entire frontend

**Alternative Considered:** Svelte (mentioned in docs)
**Why Rejected:** Would require complete rewrite, losing months of work

### Backend: Node.js + Express
**Decision:** Keep existing Node.js/Express setup  
**Why:**
- ✅ Matches frontend JavaScript skills
- ✅ Existing codebase already in Node.js
- ✅ Excellent ecosystem for API development
- ✅ Easy to hire for and maintain
- ❌ NOT switching to Python/Go/Rust - would rewrite entire backend

**Alternative Considered:** FastAPI (Python)
**Why Rejected:** Team expertise is in JavaScript, not Python

### Database: PostgreSQL with Direct SQL
**Decision:** Keep PostgreSQL, improve with connection pooling
**Why:**
- ✅ Already chosen and configured
- ✅ Excellent JSON support for flexible stats storage
- ✅ Rock-solid reliability and performance
- ✅ SQL is more transparent than ORM magic
- ❌ NOT adding Prisma/TypeORM - ORMs hide too much

**Alternative Considered:** MongoDB
**Why Rejected:** PostgreSQL JSONB gives NoSQL flexibility with SQL reliability

## Key Architecture Decisions

### API Layer: Custom Fetch Wrapper (Not Axios)
**Decision:** Build lightweight wrapper around native fetch()
**Reasoning:**
```javascript
// Problem: 20+ components with hardcoded URLs
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/services');

// Solution: Centralized API client
const services = await api.get('/api/services');
```

**Why Not Axios:**
- ✅ Native fetch is mature and well-supported (2024)
- ✅ No 50KB dependency to maintain
- ✅ Can add interceptors without library overhead
- ✅ One less thing to update and secure

**Code Impact:** Changes 20+ components but with mechanical find/replace

### State Management: React Context + useReducer (Not Redux/Zustand)
**Decision:** Use built-in React state management
**Reasoning:**
```javascript
// Current Problem: Props drilling everywhere
function App() {
  const [services, setServices] = useState([]);
  return <ServiceList services={services} setServices={setServices} />;
}

// Solution: Context + useReducer
const { services, setServices } = useAppContext();
```

**Why Not Redux:**
- ❌ 50KB+ of dependencies (redux, react-redux, @reduxjs/toolkit)
- ❌ Massive boilerplate for simple state
- ❌ Overkill for current app complexity
- ❌ Steep learning curve for contributors

**Why Not Zustand:**
- ✅ Zustand is excellent, but Context works fine
- ✅ Zero dependencies vs 5KB dependency
- ✅ Can migrate to Zustand later if needed
- ✅ Uses built-in React patterns

### Error Handling: Boundaries + Consistent Responses
**Decision:** React Error Boundaries + Standardized API responses
**Reasoning:**
```javascript
// Problem: One error crashes entire app
throw new Error('API failed'); // White screen of death

// Solution: Error boundaries contain failures
<ErrorBoundary>
  <ServiceCard />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

**Why Not Error Tracking Service (Sentry):**
- ✅ Fix stability first, then add monitoring
- ✅ Self-hosted solution doesn't need external dependencies
- ✅ Can add Sentry later once stable

### Database Layer: Connection Pooling (Not ORM)
**Decision:** PostgreSQL with pg library and connection pooling
**Reasoning:**
```javascript
// Problem: Connection exhaustion
const client = new Client(); // Creates new connection every time

// Solution: Connection pool
const pool = new Pool({ max: 10 }); // Reuse connections
```

**Why Not Prisma/TypeORM:**
- ✅ Direct SQL is more transparent and debuggable
- ✅ No abstraction layer to learn and maintain
- ✅ Better performance (no ORM overhead)
- ✅ Existing queries already written in SQL

### Testing Strategy: API-First Testing
**Decision:** Start with backend API tests using Jest + Supertest
**Reasoning:**
- ✅ Backend stability more critical than UI tests
- ✅ API tests run faster than E2E tests
- ✅ Better ROI - one API test covers multiple UI scenarios
- ✅ Can add UI tests after backend is stable

**Why Not Cypress/Playwright First:**
- ❌ E2E tests are slower and more brittle
- ❌ Backend bugs cause E2E test failures
- ❌ Harder to debug when they fail

### Authentication: Simplify Existing (Not Replace)
**Decision:** Keep JWT, remove unused RBAC complexity
**Reasoning:**
```javascript
// Problem: 300+ lines of unused RBAC code
class RolePermissionManager {
  checkPermission(user, resource, action) {
    // Complex logic nobody uses
  }
}

// Solution: Simple role check
function isAdmin(user) {
  return user.role === 'admin';
}
```

**Why Not Rebuild Auth:**
- ✅ Current JWT auth works fine
- ✅ Removing code is safer than rewriting
- ✅ Can add RBAC back when actually needed

## What We're NOT Doing (And Why)

### TypeScript Migration
**Decision:** Fix stability first, add types later
**Reasoning:**
- ❌ Adding types while fixing architecture doubles the work
- ❌ Type errors will mask structural issues
- ✅ JavaScript with good patterns is better than bad TypeScript
- ✅ Can add TypeScript incrementally later

### Microservices Architecture
**Decision:** Keep monolith, improve structure
**Reasoning:**
- ✅ Monolith is fine for current scale (10-20 users)
- ❌ Microservices add network complexity
- ❌ More deployment complexity
- ❌ Harder to debug distributed issues
- ✅ Can split into microservices when actually needed

### GraphQL API
**Decision:** Keep REST, make it consistent
**Reasoning:**
- ✅ REST is simpler and more widely understood
- ✅ Current frontend expects REST responses
- ❌ GraphQL adds complexity without clear benefit
- ❌ Over-fetching isn't a performance problem yet

### Container Orchestration (Kubernetes)
**Decision:** Docker Compose is sufficient
**Reasoning:**
- ✅ Self-hosted use case doesn't need K8s complexity
- ✅ Docker Compose handles current scale perfectly
- ❌ K8s is massive overkill for homelab dashboard
- ✅ Can containerize better before considering orchestration

## Performance vs Simplicity Trade-offs

### Chose Simplicity Over Performance

#### Caching Strategy
**Decision:** Start with in-memory caching, add Redis later
**Why:** 
- ✅ In-memory cache is simple and works for single instance
- ✅ Can add Redis when scaling to multiple instances
- ✅ Fewer moving parts during stabilization

#### Database Queries  
**Decision:** Keep direct SQL, optimize queries later
**Why:**
- ✅ SQL is transparent and debuggable
- ✅ Can add query optimization after stability
- ✅ Database performance isn't the bottleneck yet

#### Bundle Optimization
**Decision:** Fix functionality before optimizing bundle size
**Why:**
- ✅ 2MB bundle is fine for homelab use (not mobile)
- ✅ Vite already provides good defaults
- ✅ Can optimize after features are stable

## Migration Strategy Rationale

### Incremental vs Big Bang
**Decision:** Incremental migration with feature flags
**Reasoning:**
- ✅ Reduces risk of complete system failure
- ✅ Can test each component separately
- ✅ Easier to rollback individual changes
- ✅ Maintains working system during migration

### Order of Operations
**Decision:** API client → Error handling → State management → Service standardization
**Reasoning:**
1. **API client first** - Biggest immediate impact, stops URL coupling
2. **Error handling second** - Prevents cascade failures during migration  
3. **State management third** - Enables better component organization
4. **Service standardization last** - Can do gradually without breaking existing

## Monitoring & Observability Strategy

### Logging: Simple Console + File Logging
**Decision:** Reduce current over-engineered logging to basics
**Reasoning:**
- ❌ Current logger is 300+ lines for simple logging
- ✅ Console + file logging covers 90% of debugging needs
- ✅ Can add structured logging later if needed

### Metrics: Start with Basic Health Checks
**Decision:** Add /health endpoint before complex metrics
**Reasoning:**
- ✅ Health checks catch 80% of issues
- ✅ Simple to implement and debug
- ✅ Can add Prometheus/Grafana later

### Error Tracking: Log First, Service Later
**Decision:** Good logging before external error service
**Reasoning:**  
- ✅ Self-hosted solution shouldn't depend on external services
- ✅ Good logs solve most debugging needs
- ✅ Can add Sentry later for advanced tracking

## Security Architecture Decisions

### Authentication: JWT with Secure Defaults
**Decision:** Keep JWT, fix implementation issues
**Reasoning:**
- ✅ JWT is industry standard and well-understood
- ✅ Stateless tokens work well for API access
- ✅ Main issues are implementation, not JWT itself

### Secret Management: Environment Variables
**Decision:** Use .env files, no fancy secret management yet
**Reasoning:**
- ✅ Environment variables are simple and secure enough
- ✅ Docker secrets add complexity without clear benefit
- ✅ Can add Vault/HashiCorp later if needed

### API Security: Authentication Middleware
**Decision:** Add auth middleware to all routes, remove bypass
**Reasoning:**
- ✅ Security by default, not opt-in
- ✅ Middleware pattern is well-understood
- ✅ Easy to add exceptions for public endpoints
