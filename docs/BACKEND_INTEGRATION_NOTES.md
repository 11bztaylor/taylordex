# Backend Integration Session Notes

## What Was Built
1. Full CRUD API for services
2. Stats fetching from Radarr/Sonarr
3. Add Service Modal UI
4. Connected frontend to backend
5. Error handling and loading states

## Key Learnings
- Services currently stored in memory (not DB)
- Stats endpoint pattern: /api/:type/:id/stats
- Modal uses local state before saving
- Backend runs on port 5000

## Debug Points Added
- Console.log in all controllers
- Error catching with descriptive messages
- Loading states in UI components

## Still Needs
- PostgreSQL integration
- Database schema/migrations
- Service persistence
- Auto-discovery feature
