## Implementation Checklist for Each Service

When implementing stats for a service, follow this checklist:

### 1. **Update Service Backend** (`/backend/src/modules/{service}/service.js`)
```javascript
// Add these methods to getStats():
- [ ] Parallel API calls with Promise.all()
- [ ] Enhanced storage paths with duplicate detection  
- [ ] Queue/activity tracking
- [ ] Recent items processing
- [ ] Health monitoring
- [ ] Category breakdowns
- [ ] Error handling with fallbacks
```

### 2. **Update Service Card** (`/frontend/src/components/services/ServiceCard.jsx`)
```javascript
// Add service-specific stat displays:
- [ ] Primary metric display
- [ ] Secondary metrics
- [ ] Queue indicator
- [ ] Health status
```

### 3. **Update Service Detail Modal**
```javascript
// Ensure modal tabs show:
- [ ] Overview with all basic stats
- [ ] Storage tab with path details
- [ ] Activity/Queue tab
- [ ] Health tab (if applicable)
```

### 4. **Test Implementation**
- [ ] Stats load within 2 seconds
- [ ] All values display correctly
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully
- [ ] Storage deduplication works
- [ ] Byte formatting is consistent

## Quick Start for New Service

1. Copy `/backend/src/modules/sonarr/service.js` as template
2. Adjust API endpoints for target service
3. Modify stat calculations for service type
4. Test with actual service instance
5. Update frontend displays

## Notes

- **Storage Path Detection**: All services should use the enhanced storage path detection with duplicate handling
- **Docker Integration**: Services should detect if running in Docker and show host information
- **Performance**: Limit arrays to 10-20 items, use pagination for larger sets
- **Consistency**: Use the same field names across services where possible
