# Session 4 Handoff - Service Card Enhancements

## What We Built Today
1. **Delete Functionality**
   - Three-dot dropdown menu on each card
   - Delete with confirmation dialog
   - Optimistic UI updates

2. **Edit Service Modal**
   - Full CRUD operations complete
   - Enable/disable toggle fixed
   - Test connection before saving
   - API key security (optional update)

3. **Service Logos**
   - Downloaded from homelab-svg-assets
   - Stored in frontend/public/logos/
   - Gradient backgrounds per service type
   - Fallback to Heroicons if logo fails

4. **UI Improvements**
   - Better stats formatting
   - Service-specific metrics
   - Disabled service indicators
   - Loading states improved

## Files Modified
- frontend/src/components/services/ServiceCard.jsx
- frontend/src/components/services/ServicesTab.jsx
- frontend/src/components/services/EditServiceModal.jsx (NEW)
- frontend/src/components/services/AddServiceModal.jsx
- frontend/src/App.jsx
- docker-compose.yml (removed version warning)

## Key Technical Details
- Services persist in PostgreSQL
- Stats cache in service_stats table
- Frontend polls every 30 seconds
- Logos in frontend/public/logos/*.svg

## Known Issues
- None currently! All CRUD operations working

## Test Credentials
If you need to test, use:
- Host: 192.168.100.4 (or your Radarr host)
- Port: 7878 (Radarr default)
- You'll need a valid API key

## Next Session Starting Point
The Services tab is now feature-complete. Next priorities:
1. Status Dashboard - needs charts/graphs
2. Service Discovery - scan network for services
3. More service types - only *arr services work currently
